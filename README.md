# Harnessing-Machine-Learning-to-Anticipate-Infectious-Disease-Threats-with-Pandemic-Potential
With the massive emergence and exponential increase in the number of infectious diseases with pandemic potential spreading across the globe, we need a modern approach to find these sort of infectious diseases before they reach their pandemic potential , Our objective is to address this challenge by creating an IVR (interactive Voice Response) system which takes a voice input from user then queries, filters and classifies using big data whether the disease is pandemic and informs the user the results of the prediction and keeps track of it
